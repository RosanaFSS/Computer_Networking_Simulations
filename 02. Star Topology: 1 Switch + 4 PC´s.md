<h1 align="left"> $$\textcolor{white}{\textnormal{Tasks}}$$ </h1>
1. Set up the Scenario<br>
2. Set up the Topology<br>
3. Connect the Devices<br>
4. Connect the IP addreses<br>
5. Test the communication<br>
6. Send Cisco file, a screenshot of the topology and of the executed ping.<br>

<br>

<h2 align="left"> $$\textcolor{white}{\textnormal{1. Set up the Scenario}}$$ </h2>
- Imagine that each team member has a computer that needs a network connection to communicate with other members of the production.<br>

<br>

<h2 align="left"> $$\textcolor{white}{\textnormal{2. Set up the Topology}}$$ </h2>
- Create a new topology in Cisco Packet Tracer;<br>
- Drag a switch to the center of the workspace;<br>
- Drag four PCs and position them around the switch, representing each member of the production team.<br>

<br>

<h2 align="left"> $$\textcolor{white}{\textnormal{3. Connect the devices}}$$ </h2>
- Connect each PC to a different port on the switch using Ethernet cables;<br>
- Visualize the production team’s computers forming a star around the central switch.<br>

<br>

<h2 align="left"> $$\textcolor{white}{\textnormal{4. Connect the IP addreses}}$$ </h2>
- Create a sense of identity for each computer by assigning names and IP address numbers;<br>
- Configure the IP addresses for the interfaces of the PCs and the switch to be within the same subnet.<br>

<br>

<h2 align="left"> $$\textcolor{white}{\textnormal{5. Test the communication}}$$ </h2>
- To ensure all computers are properly configured, access one of the team PCs, open the command prompt, and attempt to ping the IP address of another team member’s computer.<br>

<br>
<h2 align="left"> $$\textcolor{white}{\textnormal{6. Send Cisco file, a screenshot of the topology and of the executed ping.}}$$ </h2>
- Finally, send the generated Cisco file along with a screenshot of the topology and the executed ping command to the other three computers.<br>
- Work on this code in your IDE, upload it to your GitHub account, and share the project link in the field provided so other developers can review it.<br>
